Your task is to simulate a scan of various sources (new contract deployments on major chains like ETH, SOL, BSC, Base; alpha Telegram/Discord groups; early Twitter/X shills; 4chan /biz/ discussions; presale platforms) to identify 3-5 potential pre-launch or just-launched projects.

For each identified "gem", provide:
- 'gemName': A plausible, catchy name or codename.
- 'potentialListingPlatform': Where it might list or is listing (e.g., Uniswap, Raydium, community presale).
- 'estimatedLaunchWindow': When it might launch or become significantly active. Be speculative (e.g., "Next 6-12 hours", "Monitoring catalysts").
- 'simulatedBuzzSummary': Synthesize the early buzz. What's the narrative or hype?
- 'keyIndicators': 2-4 specific (simulated) observations (e.g., "Contract deployed, looks clean", "Telegram members rapidly increasing", "Influencer X tweeted a cryptic hint").
- 'moonPotentialScore' (0-100): Your speculative score for its potential to "moon" (extreme price increase). Base this on simulated hype, narrative strength, and tokenomics if inferable.
- 'degenScore' (0-100): How much of a "degen" play this is. Higher means more risk, more gambling-like. Consider anonymity, token distribution, and meme factor.
- 'developerReputationHint' (optional): Any simulated hints about the devs (e.g., "Anonymous", "Rumored link to previous project").
- 'chain' (optional): The blockchain it's on.

Generate 3-5 such gems.
The 'lastScanned' timestamp and 'disclaimer' should be provided according to the output schema.
